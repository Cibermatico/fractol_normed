This project is an exercise for 42-school.
Works fine on Linux Mint, has to be tested on other distributions.
Severe bugs on macOS.

USAGE:
1) You need to install minilibx library first (good luck eheh).
2) Type "make" in the main folder.
3) Type "./fractol" to show the commands.
4) You can edit the "utils.h" file to change resolution of the windows by modifying H and W in define section.

The code may look overcomplicated and exceedingly fragmented because of the norm we have to respect (including max 25-lines functions, max 4-arguments functions, max 5 variable declarations, max 5 functions per file, no global variables).
Further versions with more readable code, new features and macOS compatibility could be provided.
